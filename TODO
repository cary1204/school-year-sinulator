**"Generate a seamless panoramic pixel art background for a 2D side-scrolling game, resolution 5100x460 pixels. The scene should transition smoothly across 8 school-themed zones from left to right:

    A pixel art high school classroom with desks, blackboard, and posters (quiz zone),

    A chaotic school cafeteria with scattered tables and a fight breaking out (fight zone),

    A school fire drill with alarm bells, open doors, and students exiting (fire zone),

    A quiet detention classroom with a clock, single desk, and moody lighting (detention zone),

    A snowy schoolyard with snow-covered trees and kids mid-snowball fight (snowday zone),

    A messy computer lab with laptops, wires, and snacks on desks (hackathon zone),

    A decorated gymnasium with disco lights and prom banners (prom zone),

    A graduation stage with chairs, a podium, and students tossing caps (legend zone).
    Use vibrant, detailed pixel art, with consistent lighting, cohesive transitions, and a clean retro game vibe."**
