    Size: 1600 × 450 px

    Type: Full side-scrolling background

    Style: Looping hallway with lockers, maybe a water fountain, wall posters

    - Think of this as your parallax or static background — wide enough for scrolling.

    Size: 400 × 32 px

    Type: Ground/floor tile where the player walks

    Style: Tiled school floor, grass, or linoleum

    - This will repeat across the level, so keep the edges seamless.

    Frame Size: Each frame is 32 × 48 px

    Layout: Horizontal row of 8 frames

        Frame Index	        Action

        0–3	                Walk Left
        4	                Idle/Turn

    - You can reuse the same walk animation in both directions by flipping the sprite if needed.
